        <h1>This is a motherf&#39;ing website.</h1>
        <aside>And it's f&#39;ing perfect.</aside>
    </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, what the f else do you want?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think your stuff is special. You think your 13 megabyte paralax-ative home page is going to get you some f&#39;ing Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherf&#39;er. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>It's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your crappy screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your crappy browsers</li>
            <li>The motherf&#39;er's accessible to every loser that visits your site</li>
            <li>It&#39;s legible and gets your f&#39;ing point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Well guess what, motherf&#39;er:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this site. It's a motherf&#39;ing website. Why the f do you need to animate a f&#39;ing trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of crap? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your f&#39;ing site, and some motherf&#39;er jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that stuff. Not to mention blind people will never see that stuff, but they don't see any of your crappy stuff.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h2>It's f&#39;ing lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your f&#39;ing Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the f&#39;ing background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a crappy webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of crap.</p>
        
        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You idiot. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherf&#39;ing screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherf&#39;ing Tamagotchi.</p>
        
        <h2>It f&#39;ing works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this crap. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherf&#39;er. It makes sense. It has motherf&#39;ing hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your dumbass browser know what the f&#39;s in this f&#39;ing site. That's semantics, motherf&#39;er.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the f&#39;ing screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherf&#39;er in IE6. I f&#39;ing dare you.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it.  You've never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the pansy-ass who&#39;s never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no f&#39;ing idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are crappy skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a f&#39;ing message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's f&#39;ing beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is f&#39;ing satire, you idiot</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your crappy site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>
